# Fluorite

Fluorite (CaF₂), also known as fluorspar, is a calcium fluoride mineral that serves as the principal source of fluorine for chemical and metallurgical processes worldwide. This highly versatile mineral exhibits remarkable optical properties and plays crucial roles in both industrial applications and scientific research.

## Chemical and Physical Properties

### Composition and Structure
Fluorite has the chemical formula CaF₂, consisting of calcium cations (Ca²⁺) and fluoride anions (F⁻) arranged in a cubic crystal structure. This arrangement, known as the fluorite structure, is characterized by:
- Calcium ions occupying face-centered cubic positions
- Fluoride ions filling all tetrahedral sites
- Coordination number of 8 for calcium and 4 for fluoride
- Space group Fm3m (face-centered cubic)

### Physical Characteristics
**Crystal System**: Cubic (isometric)
**Hardness**: 4 on the Mohs scale
**Specific Gravity**: 3.18
**Luster**: Vitreous to sub-vitreous
**Transparency**: Transparent to translucent
**Cleavage**: Perfect octahedral cleavage
**Fracture**: Subconchoidal to uneven
**Streak**: White

### Optical Properties
Fluorite exhibits exceptional optical properties that make it valuable for specialized applications:
- **Refractive Index**: 1.434 (very low for a mineral)
- **Dispersion**: Very low, making it ideal for achromatic lenses
- **Fluorescence**: Strong fluorescence under UV light (the phenomenon of fluorescence was named after fluorite)
- **Transparency Range**: Excellent transmission from ultraviolet through infrared

## Color Variations

Fluorite displays an extraordinary range of colors due to various impurities and structural defects:

**Purple Fluorite**: The most common variety, colored by trace amounts of yttrium or organic matter
**Green Fluorite**: Results from radiation damage or rare earth element inclusions
**Blue Fluorite**: Caused by color centers created by natural radiation
**Yellow Fluorite**: Due to minute inclusions of organic matter or rare earth elements
**Colorless Fluorite**: Pure CaF₂ without impurities
**Pink Fluorite**: Rare variety often associated with rare earth elements
**Black Fluorite**: Contains inclusions of organic matter or other minerals

## Geological Formation and Occurrence

### Formation Processes
Fluorite forms through several geological processes:

**Hydrothermal Deposits**: Most economic fluorite deposits form from hot, fluorine-rich fluids that precipitate the mineral in veins, replacement bodies, and cavity fillings.

**Sedimentary Environments**: Some fluorite deposits form through low-temperature precipitation in sedimentary rocks, often associated with limestone and dolomite.

**Pegmatites**: Fluorite can crystallize in granitic pegmatites as an accessory mineral.

**Metamorphic Processes**: High-grade metamorphism can mobilize fluorine and create fluorite-bearing assemblages.

### Global Distribution
Major fluorite producing regions include:
- **China**: World's largest producer, primarily from Hunan and Zhejiang provinces
- **Mexico**: Significant deposits in Coahuila and San Luis Potosí
- **South Africa**: Important deposits in the Bushveld Complex
- **Mongolia**: Large reserves in various regions
- **Russia**: Deposits in Siberia and other regions
- **United States**: Illinois, Kentucky, and Nevada (historically important)

## Industrial Applications
