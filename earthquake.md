**Earthquakes** are sudden releases of energy in the Earth's crust that create seismic waves, resulting in ground shaking and potentially causing significant geological and structural changes.

## Causes and Mechanics

Earthquakes are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates. As these massive sections of the Earth's lithosphere interact at their boundaries, they can:

- **Slide past each other** at transform boundaries (like the San Andreas Fault)
- **Collide** at convergent boundaries, creating mountain ranges
- **Pull apart** at divergent boundaries, forming rift valleys

The sudden release of accumulated stress along fault lines generates seismic waves that radiate outward from the earthquake's focus (hypocenter) through the Earth's layers.

## Seismic Waves

Earthquakes produce several types of seismic waves:

- **P-waves (Primary)**: Fastest-moving compression waves
- **S-waves (Secondary)**: Slower shear waves that cause lateral motion
- **Surface waves**: Slowest but most destructive waves that travel along the Earth's surface

## Measurement and Classification

Earthquake magnitude is commonly measured using:

- **Richter Scale**: Logarithmic scale measuring energy release
- **Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw)**: More accurate for large earthquakes
- **Mercalli Intensity Scale**: Measures observed effects and damage

## Terraforming Implications

In terraforming contexts, understanding seismic activity is crucial for:

- **Planetary Assessment**: Evaluating geological stability of target worlds
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Designing earthquake-resistant habitats and installations
- **Resource Mapping**: Locating geologically active regions that might provide geothermal energy
- **Safety Protocols**: Establishing early warning systems for colonization efforts

## Geological Impact

Earthquakes play essential roles in planetary geology by:

- Reshaping surface topography
- Creating new landforms and modifying existing ones
- Influencing groundwater flow patterns
- Triggering volcanic activity in some regions
- Contributing to the carbon cycle through rock fracturing

## Prediction and Monitoring

Modern seismology employs various technologies:

- **Seismometer networks** for real-time monitoring
- **GPS systems** to track ground movement
- **Satellite imagery** for detecting surface deformation
- **Computer modeling** for risk assessment

Understanding earthquake patterns helps scientists predict geological behavior on both Earth and potential terraforming targets, making seismic knowledge fundamental to planetary engineering projects.
