**Geology** is the science that studies the Earth's physical structure, substance, history, and the processes that shape it over time. In terraforming contexts, geological knowledge is fundamental for understanding planetary formation, resource distribution, and the long-term stability of engineered environments.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Earth's Structure

#### Crust
- **Continental crust**: Thick (30-70 km), less dense, primarily granitic composition
- **Oceanic crust**: Thin (5-10 km), more dense, primarily basaltic composition
- **Surface features**: Mountains, valleys, plains, and ocean basins

#### Mantle
- **Upper mantle**: Partially molten rock (asthenosphere) driving plate tectonics
- **Lower mantle**: Solid rock under extreme pressure and temperature
- **Convection currents**: Heat transfer driving geological processes

#### Core
- **Outer core**: Liquid iron-nickel generating Earth's magnetic field
- **Inner core**: Solid iron-nickel under extreme pressure
- **Geodynamo**: Magnetic field generation protecting atmosphere

### Rock Types and Formation

#### Igneous Rocks
- **Intrusive**: Granite, diorite formed from slow cooling underground
- **Extrusive**: Basalt, obsidian formed from rapid surface cooling
- **Volcanic processes**: Magma movement and eruption mechanisms

#### Sedimentary Rocks
- **Clastic**: Sandstone, shale formed from weathered rock fragments
- **Chemical**: Limestone, evaporites from chemical precipitation
- **Organic**: Coal, oil shale from biological material accumulation

#### Metamorphic Rocks
- **Regional metamorphism**: Large-scale transformation under pressure
- **Contact metamorphism**: Heat-driven changes near igneous intrusions
- **Examples**: Marble, quartzite, schist, gneiss

## Geological Processes

### Plate Tectonics

#### Plate Boundaries
- **Divergent**: Mid-ocean ridges creating new oceanic crust
- **Convergent**: Subduction zones and mountain-building collision zones
- **Transform**: Lateral sliding boundaries like the San Andreas Fault
