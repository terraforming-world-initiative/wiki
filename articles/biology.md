Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It forms the foundation for understanding how to establish, maintain, and evolve ecosystems in terraforming projects, from microbial communities to complex food webs.

## Fundamental Principles

### Life Characteristics
- **Cellular organization** - basic unit of life
- **Metabolism** - energy processing and chemical reactions
- **Growth and reproduction** - continuation of species
- **Adaptation** - response to environmental changes
- **Evolution** - genetic change over time

### Biological Systems
- **Molecular biology** - DNA, proteins, and cellular machinery
- **Ecology** - organism-environment interactions
- **Physiology** - organism function and processes
- **Genetics** - inheritance and genetic variation

## Terraforming Applications

### Ecosystem Design
- **Food web** construction and stability
- **Nutrient cycling** establishment
- **Primary productivity** optimization
- **Biodiversity** planning for resilience

### Organism Selection
- **Pioneer species** for initial colonization
- **Keystone species** for ecosystem stability
- **Extremophile** adaptation for harsh conditions
- **Agricultural species** for food production

### Biological Engineering
- **Genetic modification** for environmental adaptation
- **Synthetic biology** for novel functions
- **Conservation biology** for species preservation
- **Population dynamics** for sustainable ecosystems
