# Himalayas

The Himalayas, often called "the roof of the world," constitute the highest mountain range on Earth, stretching approximately 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) across South and East Asia. This magnificent mountain system contains nine of the world's ten highest peaks, including Mount Everest, and serves as the source of major river systems that sustain billions of people across the Asian continent.

## Geographic Extent and Location

### Regional Coverage
The Himalayan range spans across eight countries:
- **Nepal**: Contains the central high peaks including Everest
- **India**: Northern states including Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim
- **China/Tibet**: Northern slopes and Tibetan Plateau interface
- **Pakistan**: Western extremes including K2 region
- **Afghanistan**: Hindu Kush connection
- **Bhutan**: Eastern Himalayas
- **Bangladesh**: Foothills region
- **Myanmar**: Eastern extremes

### Mountain Subdivisions
The Himalayas are traditionally divided into three parallel ranges:

**Greater Himalayas (Himadri)**: The highest range
- Contains peaks above 6,000 meters
- Includes all 8,000-meter peaks
- Perpetual snow and glaciation
- Sharp ridges and deep valleys

**Lesser Himalayas (Himachal)**: The middle range
- Elevations between 1,000-5,000 meters
- Important hill stations and settlements
- Moderate climate zones
- Significant biodiversity

**Siwalik Hills (Outer Himalayas)**: The southern foothills
- Elevations below 1,500 meters
- Transition to Indo-Gangetic Plain
- Dense population and agriculture
- Recent geological formations

## Geological Formation and Structure

### Tectonic Origins
The Himalayas formed through the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates beginning approximately 50-70 million years ago:

**Continental Collision**: The most dramatic mountain-building process
- Indian plate moving northward at 40-50 mm/year
- Ongoing compression and uplift
- Creation of the Tibetan Plateau
- Continued seismic activity

**Crustal Thickening**: Extreme crustal deformation
- Double-thick continental crust (up to 70 km)
- Intense folding and faulting
- Metamorphic rock formation
- Isostatic adjustment processes

### Rock Types and Formations
**Sedimentary Rocks**: Ancient ocean floor deposits
- Limestone and shale formations
- Fossil marine organisms at high elevations
- Evidence of Tethys Sea closure
- Folded and uplifted sequences

**Metamorphic Rocks**: Transformed under pressure
- Gneiss and schist formations
- High-grade metamorphic assemblages
- Evidence of extreme pressure and temperature
- Complex structural relationships

**Igneous Rocks**: Granite intrusions and volcanic activity
- Plutonic intrusions during collision
- Limited volcanic activity
- Pegmatite and mineral deposits
- Geothermal systems
