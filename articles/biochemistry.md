Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within living organisms. Understanding biochemical principles is essential for terraforming projects involving life support systems, ecosystem establishment, and the modification of organisms for extreme environments.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Molecular Biology
- **Proteins** - structural and enzymatic functions
- **Nucleic acids** - genetic information storage
- **Carbohydrates** - energy storage and structure
- **Lipids** - membranes and energy storage
