The Banach–Tarski paradox is a mathematical theorem demonstrating that a solid ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two identical copies. While purely theoretical, it illustrates fundamental principles about space, geometry, and the nature of physical reality relevant to advanced terraforming concepts.

## Mathematical Concept

- **Geometric decomposition** into unmeasurable sets
- **Non-constructive proof** using axiom of choice
