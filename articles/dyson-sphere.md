**Dyson Sphere** is a hypothetical megastructure concept that completely encompasses a star to capture its energy output, representing one of the most ambitious engineering projects conceivable for advanced civilizations.

## Concept and Origin

### Freeman Dyson's Proposal
Physicist Freeman Dyson proposed in 1960 that advanced civilizations would eventually require energy resources on the scale of their entire star's output. Rather than a solid shell, Dyson envisioned a swarm of orbiting structures collecting solar energy.

### Motivations for Construction
- **Energy Demands**: Growing civilizations need exponentially increasing energy
- **Resource Utilization**: Maximum use of available solar energy
- **Technological Advancement**: Represents Type II civilization on Kardashev Scale
- **Population Growth**: Supporting massive populations across solar systems
