**Celestine** (also known as celestite) is a strontium sulfate mineral (SrSO₄) valued for its industrial applications in pyrotechnics, chemical production, and potential uses in terraforming operations.

## Physical and Chemical Properties

### Crystal Structure
- **Crystal System**: Orthorhombic
- **Chemical Formula**: SrSO₄ (Strontium Sulfate)
- **Color**: Typically colorless to pale blue, sometimes white, yellow, or reddish
- **Hardness**: 3-3.5 on the Mohs scale
- **Specific Gravity**: 3.95-3.97
- **Luster**: Vitreous to pearly

### Physical Characteristics
- **Transparency**: Transparent to translucent
- **Cleavage**: Perfect in one direction, good in another
- **Fracture**: Uneven to subconchoidal
- **Streak**: White
- **Fluorescence**: Sometimes exhibits fluorescence under UV light

## Formation and Occurrence

### Geological Formation
Celestine forms through several geological processes:

#### Evaporite Deposits
- Forms in ancient sea beds through evaporation of strontium-rich waters
- Associated with other evaporite minerals like gypsum and halite
- Common in sedimentary sequences

#### Hydrothermal Processes
- Precipitates from hot, mineral-rich fluids
- Often found in association with sulfide ore deposits
- Can form in geothermal environments

#### Secondary Formation
- Results from weathering of strontium-bearing rocks
- Can form through replacement of other minerals
- Often associated with limestone and dolomite

### Global Distribution
