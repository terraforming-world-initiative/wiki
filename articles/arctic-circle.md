The Arctic Circle is the northernmost major circle of latitude on Earth, marking the boundary where polar day and night phenomena occur. Understanding these astronomical and climatic boundaries is essential for terraforming planets with significant axial tilt.

## Definition

- **Latitude**: 66° 33′ 46″ North
- **Astronomical significance**: Polar day/night boundary
- **Seasonal variation**: Continuous daylight/darkness periods
- **Climate demarcation**: Marking Arctic climate zone
- **Vegetation limit**: Northern boundary of tree growth

## Astronomical Mechanics

### Earth's Axial Tilt
- **23.5-degree inclination** creates seasonal variations
- **Obliquity changes** over 41,000-year cycles
- **Precession effects** on seasonal timing
- **Solstice positions** determining circle location

### Polar Phenomena
- **Midnight sun** during summer solstice
- **Polar night** during winter solstice
- **Civil twilight** effects on daily rhythms
- **Aurora visibility** enhanced at high latitudes
