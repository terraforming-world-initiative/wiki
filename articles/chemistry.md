Chemistry is the science of matter and chemical reactions, forming the foundation of all terraforming processes. Understanding chemical principles enables the transformation of hostile planetary environments into habitable worlds.

## Fundamental Principles

### Atomic Structure
- **Elements and compounds** - building blocks of all matter
- **Chemical bonds** - ionic, covalent, and metallic interactions
- **Molecular structure** - determining material properties
- **Periodic table** - organizing elements by properties

### Chemical Reactions
- **Synthesis reactions** - creating complex compounds
- **Decomposition** - breaking down materials
- **Redox reactions** - electron transfer processes
- **Catalysis** - accelerating reaction rates
