Bacteria are single-celled prokaryotic organisms that could play essential roles in terraforming through their diverse metabolic capabilities, rapid reproduction, and ability to modify environments at a planetary scale.

## Characteristics

- **Prokaryotic** cells without membrane-bound nucleus
- **Rapid reproduction** through binary fission
- **Metabolic diversity** - countless biochemical pathways
- **Environmental adaptation** to extreme conditions
- **Horizontal gene transfer** for rapid evolution

## Terraforming Applications

### Atmospheric Engineering
- **Oxygen production** through photosynthesis (cyanobacteria)
- **Methane consumption** by methanotrophic bacteria
- **Nitrogen fixation** for agricultural development
- **Greenhouse gas processing** for climate control

### Soil Development
- **Organic matter decomposition** creating soil layers
- **Nutrient cycling** for ecosystem establishment
- **Rock weathering** through acid production
- **Symbiotic relationships** with plants

### Extremophile Applications
- **Thermophiles** for high-temperature environments
- **Psychrophiles** for cold planet adaptation
- **Halophiles** for high-salinity conditions
- **Acidophiles** for harsh chemical environments

### Bioengineering
- **Genetic modification** for specific terraforming functions
- **Synthetic biology** for novel capabilities
- **Biosensors** for environmental monitoring
- **Bioremediation** for contaminated environments

## Implementation Strategies

- **Staged introduction** of bacterial communities
- **Ecosystem monitoring** and management
- **Containment protocols** for safety
- **Adaptation monitoring** for evolutionary changes
