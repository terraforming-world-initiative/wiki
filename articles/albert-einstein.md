**Albert Einstein** (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time, matter, and energy through his theories of special and general relativity. His groundbreaking work fundamentally changed physics and provided essential theoretical foundations for modern space exploration, interstellar travel, and the ambitious terraforming projects that may one day transform other worlds.

## Early Life and Education

### Birth and Childhood
Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch Einstein. The family moved to Munich when Albert was one year old, where his father and uncle founded an electrical equipment company.

### Educational Journey
Contrary to popular myth, Einstein was an excellent student who showed early aptitude for mathematics and physics. He taught himself algebra and geometry, and by age 12 had learned Euclidean geometry from a school textbook. He attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, graduating in 1900 with a teaching diploma in physics and mathematics.

### Early Career Struggles
After graduation, Einstein struggled to find academic positions and worked as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern from 1902 to 1909. This period of relative intellectual isolation proved remarkably productive, leading to his "miracle year" of 1905.
