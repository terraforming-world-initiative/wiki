The Aqua-Lung, developed by Jacques Cousteau and Ã‰mile Gagnan in 1943, revolutionized underwater breathing technology. Its principles contribute to life support system development for terraforming applications and hostile environment exploration.

## Technology Principles

- **Demand regulator** system for breathing gas
- **Pressure compensation** for depth changes
- **Portable life support** for hostile environments
- **Gas mixture control** for extended operations

## Historical Development

### Original Innovation
- **1943**: First successful prototype
- **Wartime development** under German occupation
- **Automotive regulator** adaptation for diving
- **Two-stage pressure reduction** system

### Post-War Evolution
- **Commercial production** beginning 1946
- **Safety improvements** and standardization
- **Military applications** for underwater operations
- **Scientific research** enabling ocean exploration

## Relevance to Terraforming

### Life Support Systems
