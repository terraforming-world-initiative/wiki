**Isaac Asimov** (1920-1992) was an American author and biochemist who became one of the most influential science fiction writers of all time. His visionary works exploring robotics, space colonization, and galactic civilizations profoundly shaped modern concepts of technology, artificial intelligence, and humanity's future among the stars.

## Early Life and Education

Born Isaak Yudovich Ozimov in Petrovichi, Russia, Asimov immigrated to the United States with his family when he was three years old. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, he showed exceptional intellectual ability and graduated from high school at age 15. He earned his PhD in biochemistry from Columbia University in 1948 while simultaneously beginning his writing career.

## Literary Career

### Science Fiction Foundation
Asimov began writing science fiction in 1938, publishing his first story "Marooned Off Vesta" in Amazing Stories magazine. His early works established themes that would define his career:
- **Scientific rationalism**: Stories based on logical extrapolation from known science
- **Technological optimism**: Belief in science's power to solve human problems
- **Social evolution**: Exploration of how technology transforms society
- **Galactic perspective**: Vast scales of time and space

### Major Works and Series

#### Foundation Series
Asimov's most famous work, the Foundation series, depicts the fall and renewal of a galactic empire:
- **Psychohistory**: Mathematical prediction of societal trends
- **Seldon Plan**: Guided evolution of civilization
- **Galactic scale**: Spanning thousands of years and millions of worlds
- **Social engineering**: Planned reconstruction of interstellar society

#### Robot Series
Asimov's robot stories revolutionized the portrayal of artificial intelligence:
- **Three Laws of Robotics**: Fundamental programming constraints
- **Positronic brains**: Advanced artificial intelligence systems
- **Human-robot relationships**: Exploration of coexistence and cooperation
- **Ethical implications**: Moral questions surrounding artificial life

#### Empire Series
Bridging his robot and Foundation universes:
- **Galactic colonization**: Humanity's expansion across the galaxy
- **Technological development**: Evolution from robots to psychohistory
- **Cultural transformation**: Changes in human society over millennia

## The Three Laws of Robotics

Asimov's most enduring contribution to robotics and AI ethics:

1. **First Law**: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. **Second Law**: A robot must obey orders given by human beings, except where such orders conflict with the First Law.
3. **Third Law**: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Later, he added the **Zeroth Law**: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
