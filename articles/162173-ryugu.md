**162173 Ryugu** is a near-Earth asteroid and the target of JAXA's groundbreaking Hayabusa2 sample-return mission. This diamond-shaped, carbon-rich asteroid has provided unprecedented insights into the early solar system, asteroid composition, and the potential for space resource utilization in future terraforming endeavors.

## Discovery and Designation

### Initial Discovery
Ryugu was discovered on May 10, 1999, by the LINEAR (Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research) program at Socorro, New Mexico. Initially designated 1999 JU3, it was later given the permanent designation 162173 and named Ryugu after the undersea palace in Japanese folklore from the tale of Urashima Tarō.

### Naming Significance
The name "Ryugu" (竜宮) refers to the dragon palace at the bottom of the sea in Japanese mythology, where the fisherman Urashima Tarō visited and received a mysterious box. This name reflects the mission's goal of bringing back samples from this distant celestial body, much like Urashima Tarō's journey to another realm.

## Physical Characteristics

### Size and Shape
- **Diameter**: Approximately 1.13 kilometers at its widest point
- **Shape**: Distinctive diamond or spinning-top configuration
- **Rotation period**: 7.63 hours
- **Density**: 1.19 g/cm³ (indicating a rubble pile structure)

### Surface Features
Hayabusa2's detailed observations revealed:
- **Rough, boulder-strewn surface** with rocks ranging from centimeters to tens of meters
- **Low albedo** (reflectivity) of about 0.04, making it darker than charcoal
