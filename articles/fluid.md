**Fluids** are substances that continuously deform under applied shear stress, including both liquids and gases. In terraforming contexts, understanding fluid behavior is crucial for atmospheric engineering, hydrological systems, and life support technologies.

## Fundamental Properties

### Definition and Characteristics
A fluid is distinguished from solids by its inability to resist shear stress indefinitely. Key properties include:

- **Viscosity**: Resistance to flow and deformation
- **Density**: Mass per unit volume
- **Compressibility**: Response to pressure changes
- **Surface tension**: Cohesive forces at interfaces
- **Thermal conductivity**: Heat transfer capability

### Types of Fluids

#### Liquids
- **Nearly incompressible** under normal conditions
- **Fixed volume** but take shape of container
- **High density** compared to gases
- **Significant intermolecular forces**

#### Gases
- **Highly compressible** under pressure
- **Expand to fill container** completely
- **Low density** relative to liquids
- **Weak intermolecular forces**

#### Plasma
- **Ionized gas** with free electrons and ions
- **Electromagnetic properties** distinct from neutral fluids
- **High-temperature state** found in stars and fusion reactors

## Fluid Mechanics Principles

### Fundamental Equations

#### Conservation of Mass (Continuity)
The continuity equation governs fluid flow:
ρ₁A₁v₁ = ρ₂A₂v₂

Where ρ = density, A = cross-sectional area, v = velocity

#### Conservation of Momentum (Navier-Stokes)
Describes fluid motion under various forces:
ρ(dv/dt) = -∇p + μ∇²v + F

Where p = pressure, μ = viscosity, F = body forces

#### Conservation of Energy
Governs heat transfer and thermodynamic processes in fluid systems.

### Flow Regimes

#### Laminar Flow
- **Smooth, ordered motion** in parallel layers
- **Low Reynolds number** (Re < 2300 for pipes)
- **Predictable behavior** suitable for precise applications

#### Turbulent Flow
- **Chaotic, mixing motion** with eddies and vortices
- **High Reynolds number** (Re > 4000 for pipes)
- **Enhanced heat and mass transfer** but higher energy losses

#### Transitional Flow
- **Intermediate regime** between laminar and turbulent
- **Unstable behavior** with intermittent characteristics
