Cadmium is a soft, bluish-white toxic heavy metal with the chemical symbol Cd and atomic number 48. While highly toxic to biological systems, cadmium has specialized applications in technology and industry that could be relevant to terraforming infrastructure.

## Properties

- **Atomic number**: 48
- **Symbol**: Cd
- **Density**: 8.65 g/cm³
- **Melting point**: 321.07°C (609.93°F)
- **Boiling point**: 767°C (1,413°F)
- **Color**: Silvery-blue metallic
- **Toxicity**: Highly toxic to humans and ecosystems

## Industrial Applications

### Energy Storage
- **Nickel-cadmium batteries** for reliable power systems
- **Backup power** for critical terraforming equipment
- **Long-term energy storage** in harsh environments
- **Low-temperature performance** for cold planet applications

### Specialized Uses
- **Nuclear reactor control rods** for neutron absorption
- **Corrosion-resistant plating** for equipment protection
- **Pigments and coatings** for specialized applications
- **Semiconductor manufacturing** for electronic components

## Terraforming Considerations

### Limited Applications
- **Controlled industrial use** only in isolated systems
- **Specialized equipment** where alternatives unavailable
- **Nuclear technology** for power generation
- **Emergency backup systems** with containment protocols

### Environmental Hazards
- **Bioaccumulation** in food chains
- **Soil contamination** from improper disposal
- **Water system toxicity** requiring strict controls
- **Atmospheric release** prevention essential

### Safe Handling Protocols
- **Complete containment** systems required
- **Recycling programs** for cadmium recovery
- **Alternative materials** preferred when possible
- **Environmental monitoring** for contamination detection
