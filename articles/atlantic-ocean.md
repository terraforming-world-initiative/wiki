The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean on Earth and plays a crucial role in global climate regulation through thermohaline circulation. Understanding Atlantic dynamics provides essential insights for designing ocean systems in terraformed worlds.

## Characteristics

- **Area**: 106.5 million kmÂ²
- **Average depth**: 3,332 meters
- **Maximum depth**: 8,486 meters (Puerto Rico Trench)
- **S-shaped basin** between continents
- **Mid-Atlantic Ridge** - active spreading center

## Climate Regulation

### Thermohaline Circulation
- **Gulf Stream** - warm water transport northward
- **Deep water formation** in polar regions
- **Global conveyor belt** circulation pattern
- **Heat redistribution** from equator to poles

### Weather Patterns
- **Hurricane formation** and development
- **Storm track** influence on continental weather
- **Seasonal temperature** moderation for coastal regions
- **Evaporation source** for precipitation patterns

## Terraforming Applications

### Ocean Design
- **Basin geometry** effects on circulation
- **Thermal regulation** through ocean currents
- **Climate stability** through thermal mass
- **Weather pattern** control systems

### Marine Ecosystems
- **Primary productivity** zones establishment
- **Deep ocean** ecosystem development
- **Migration routes** for marine life
- **Carbon cycling** through marine organisms

### Resource Management
- **Fisheries development** for food security
- **Mineral extraction** from ocean floor
- **Energy generation** from ocean currents
- **Transportation routes** for global connectivity
