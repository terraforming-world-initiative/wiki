A biome is a large-scale ecological unit characterized by distinctive plant and animal communities adapted to specific climate conditions. Understanding biome structure and function is essential for designing diverse, stable ecosystems in terraformed environments.

## Major Earth Biomes

### Terrestrial Biomes
- **Tropical rainforest** - high biodiversity, warm, wet
- **Temperate forest** - deciduous and coniferous trees
- **Grassland** - prairies and savannas
- **Desert** - arid conditions, specialized adaptations
- **Tundra** - cold, permafrost, limited growing season
- **Taiga** - boreal forest, coniferous trees

### Aquatic Biomes
- **Freshwater** - lakes, rivers, streams
- **Marine** - oceans, coral reefs, deep sea
- **Wetlands** - marshes, swamps, bogs
- **Estuaries** - where rivers meet oceans

## Terraforming Applications

### Biome Design
- **Climate matching** to planetary conditions
- **Species selection** for each biome type
- **Transition zones** between different biomes
- **Microclimate creation** for biome establishment

### Ecosystem Services
- **Carbon sequestration** for atmospheric regulation
- **Water cycle** regulation and purification
- **Soil formation** and nutrient cycling
- **Climate moderation** through vegetation

### Biodiversity Strategy
- **Multiple biomes** for ecosystem resilience
- **Genetic diversity** within species populations
- **Corridor connections** between biome patches
- **Adaptive management** for changing conditions

### Implementation Phases
- **Pioneer biome** establishment first
- **Gradual expansion** to adjacent areas
- **Succession management** toward target biomes
- **Long-term monitoring** and adjustment
