Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is a crucial atmospheric gas that plays a central role in terraforming efforts. As both a greenhouse gas and raw material for biological processes, CO₂ management is essential for creating habitable planetary environments.

## Chemical Properties

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas composed of one Carbon atom bonded to two Oxygen atoms. It is denser than air, soluble in water forming carbonic acid, and essential for photosynthesis in plants and other organisms.

### Physical Characteristics
- **Molecular formula**: CO₂
- **Density**: 1.98 kg/m³ (heavier than air)
- **Solubility**: Dissolves in water to form carbonic acid
- **Phase transitions**: Sublimates directly from solid to gas at -78.5°C

## Role in Planetary Atmospheres

### Greenhouse Effect
CO₂ is a potent greenhouse gas that traps thermal radiation:
- **Heat retention**: Absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation
- **Temperature regulation**: Controls planetary surface temperatures
- **Climate stability**: Maintains habitable temperature ranges
- **Atmospheric dynamics**: Influences weather patterns and circulation

### Planetary Examples
- **Earth**: 0.04% atmospheric concentration, supporting moderate greenhouse effect
- **Mars**: 95% of thin atmosphere, insufficient for significant warming
- **Venus**: 96% of dense atmosphere, creating extreme greenhouse conditions

## Terraforming Applications
