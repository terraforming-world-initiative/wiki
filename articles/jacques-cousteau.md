**Jacques-Yves Cousteau** (1910-1997) was a French naval officer, explorer, conservationist, filmmaker, innovator, scientist, photographer, author, and researcher who revolutionized underwater exploration and marine conservation. His pioneering work in developing underwater breathing apparatus and submersible technologies laid the foundation for modern oceanography and has significant implications for terraforming aquatic environments.

## Early Life and Naval Career

Born in Saint-André-de-Cubzac, France, Cousteau developed an early fascination with water and mechanical devices. He graduated from the École Navale (French Naval Academy) in 1933 and became a naval aviator. However, a near-fatal car accident in 1936 ended his aviation career and led him to focus on underwater exploration as rehabilitation.
