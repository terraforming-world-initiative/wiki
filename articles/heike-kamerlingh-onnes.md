**Heike Kamerlingh Onnes** (1853-1926) was a Dutch physicist who made groundbreaking contributions to low-temperature physics and discovered the phenomenon of superconductivity. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913 for his investigations into the properties of matter at low temperatures, which led to the production of liquid helium.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Groningen, Netherlands, Kamerlingh Onnes showed early aptitude for mathematics and physics. He studied at the University of Groningen, where he earned his doctorate in 1879 with a thesis on the kinetic theory of gases. His doctoral work already demonstrated his interest in the molecular basis of physical phenomena.

## Academic Career

### University of Leiden
In 1882, Kamerlingh Onnes became professor of experimental physics at Leiden University, where he would remain for the rest of his career. He established what became known as the Leiden Laboratory, which under his leadership became the world's leading center for low-temperature physics research.

### Research Philosophy
Kamerlingh Onnes believed in the motto "Door meten tot weten" ("Through measurement to knowledge"), emphasizing the importance of precise experimental work in advancing scientific understanding.

## Major Scientific Achievements

### Liquefaction of Helium (1908)
Kamerlingh Onnes's most famous early achievement was the first successful liquefaction of helium on July 10, 1908. This breakthrough:
