A **fjord** is a long, narrow inlet of the sea between cliffs or steep slopes, formed by glacial erosion. These dramatic coastal features are characterized by their U-shaped valleys that have been carved by glaciers and subsequently flooded by rising sea levels or land subsidence.

## Formation

Fjords are created through a multi-stage geological process:

### Glacial Carving
During ice ages, massive glaciers flow down pre-existing river valleys, gradually widening and deepening them through erosion. The immense weight and movement of ice carves characteristic U-shaped valleys with steep sides and relatively flat bottoms.

### Post-Glacial Flooding
As glaciers retreat due to climate warming, the carved valleys are flooded by seawater. This creates the distinctive fjord landscape of deep water channels surrounded by towering cliffs.

### Sill Formation
Many fjords feature a shallow threshold or "sill" at their mouth, created by terminal moraines left by retreating glaciers. These sills can restrict water circulation and create unique marine environments.

## Physical Characteristics

### Depth
Fjords can be extremely deep, often much deeper than the adjacent continental shelf. Some Norwegian fjords exceed 1,300 meters (4,300 feet) in depth.

### Length
Fjords vary greatly in length, from a few kilometers to over 200 kilometers. The longest fjord system, Scoresby Sound in Greenland, extends approximately 350 kilometers inland.

### Water Properties
- **Salinity**: Generally decreases with depth due to freshwater input from rivers and melting ice
- **Temperature**: Often stratified, with warmer surface waters and colder deep waters
- **Circulation**: Limited by sills, creating unique water exchange patterns

## Global Distribution

### Norway
Norway hosts the world's most famous fjords, including:
- **Geirangerfjord**: UNESCO World Heritage site known for its waterfalls
- **Nærøyfjord**: One of the narrowest fjords in the world
- **Sognefjord**: Norway's longest and deepest fjord

### Other Regions
- **Greenland**: Contains the world's largest fjord systems
- **Chile**: Extensive fjord networks along the southern coast
- **Alaska**: Glacier Bay and other protected fjord systems
- **New Zealand**: Fiordland National Park features 14 major fjords
- **Scotland**: Sea lochs along the western Highlands
- **Canada**: British Columbia and the Arctic archipelago

## Marine Ecosystems

Fjords support unique and often highly productive marine ecosystems:

### Endemic Species
The isolated nature of fjords can lead to the evolution of endemic species adapted to specific conditions.

### Deep-Water Communities
The deep, cold waters support communities typically found in open ocean environments, including cold-water corals and deep-sea fish species.

### Surface Productivity
The mixing of fresh and salt water, combined with nutrient input from terrestrial sources, often creates highly productive surface waters supporting rich marine food webs.

## Human Significance

### Transportation
Fjords have historically served as important transportation corridors, providing protected waterways for maritime navigation.

### Settlement Patterns
Many coastal communities are located at fjord heads, taking advantage of protected harbors and access to both marine and terrestrial resources.

### Economic Activities
- **Aquaculture**: Salmon farming is particularly important in Norwegian and Chilean fjords
- **Tourism**: Fjord landscapes attract millions of visitors annually
- **Shipping**: Deep-water access allows large vessels to reach inland ports

## Climate and Environmental Factors

### Climate Sensitivity
Fjord environments are particularly sensitive to climate change:
- Changing precipitation patterns affect freshwater input
- Temperature changes impact marine ecosystems
- Glacial retreat can alter fjord morphology

### Water Quality
Fjords can be vulnerable to pollution due to limited water circulation, making them important areas for environmental monitoring and protection.

## Terraforming Applications

In hypothetical terraforming scenarios, fjord-like features could serve important functions:

### Water Management
- Creating deep freshwater reservoirs in mountainous terrain
- Establishing protected harbors for maritime operations
- Managing water circulation in enclosed systems

### Ecosystem Development
- Providing diverse aquatic habitats for introduced species
- Creating transition zones between marine and freshwater environments
- Supporting complex food webs in isolated systems

### Infrastructure
- Natural harbors for transportation and logistics
- Protected sites for aquaculture operations
- Strategic locations for monitoring stations

## Conservation

Many fjord systems are protected as national parks or UNESCO World Heritage sites due to their:
- Exceptional natural beauty
- Unique geological features
- Important marine ecosystems
- Cultural and historical significance

The preservation of these environments is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and understanding past climate changes through geological and biological records preserved in fjord sediments.

## Related Geological Features

Fjords are closely related to other glacially-carved features including **glacial valleys**, **hanging valleys**, and **rias** (drowned river valleys). Understanding fjord formation provides insights into past glacial activity and climate history.
