# Hall Effect

The Hall effect is a fundamental electromagnetic phenomenon discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879, describing the generation of a voltage difference (Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor when subjected to both an electric current and a perpendicular magnetic field. This effect has become one of the most important principles in modern electronics, serving as the foundation for numerous sensors and measurement devices.

## Physical Principles

### Basic Mechanism
The Hall effect occurs when charge carriers (electrons or holes) moving through a conductor experience a Lorentz force due to a perpendicular magnetic field:

**Lorentz Force**: F = q(v × B)
- q: charge of the carrier
- v: velocity of the charge carrier
- B: magnetic field strength
- ×: vector cross product

**Charge Deflection**: The magnetic force deflects moving charges toward one side of the conductor, creating:
- Charge accumulation on one side
- Charge depletion on the opposite side
- Electric field across the conductor width
- Measurable voltage difference (Hall voltage)

### Hall Voltage Calculation
The Hall voltage (VH) is given by:

**VH = (IB)/(nqt)**

Where:
- I: current through the conductor
- B: magnetic field strength
- n: charge carrier density
- q: charge of the carrier
- t: thickness of the conductor

**Hall Coefficient**: RH = 1/(nq)
- Provides information about charge carrier properties
- Positive for holes, negative for electrons
- Independent of current and magnetic field
- Material-specific constant

## Types of Hall Effect

The original Hall effect observed in normal conductors:
- **Linear Relationship**: Voltage proportional to magnetic field

**Integer Quantum Hall Effect**:
- Discovered by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980

### Anomalous Hall Effect
Observed in ferromagnetic materials:
- **Spontaneous Hall Effect**: Occurs without external magnetic field
