Black-body radiation describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an object in thermal equilibrium. Understanding this fundamental physics concept is crucial for terraforming applications involving thermal management, energy systems, and planetary climate engineering.

## Physical Principles

### Planck's Law
- **Energy distribution** across electromagnetic spectrum
- **Temperature dependence** of radiation intensity
- **Peak wavelength** shifts with temperature (Wien's law)
- **Total energy** emission (Stefan-Boltzmann law)

### Key Characteristics
- **Perfect absorber** and emitter of radiation
- **Temperature-dependent** spectral distribution
- **Quantum mechanics** foundation for understanding
- **Universal behavior** independent of material composition

## Terraforming Applications
